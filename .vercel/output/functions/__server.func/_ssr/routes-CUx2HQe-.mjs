This desk may be used in educational harm-reduction and recreational-safety review for licensed healthcare professionals and trained safety staff, including analysis of stimulant, sedative, dissociative, and street-supply combinations. Where local drug-checking services are available, purity and content testing services are complementary harm-reduction tools; they are not urine testing, not patient-directed dosing guidance, and not a substitute for the relevant FDA-approved Prescribing Information or local protocols. It is not intended for patient self-treatment, recreational dosing, or direct medical decision-making without independent review of the relevant FDA-approved Prescribing Information and local protocols. It is not intended to diagnose, treat, mitigate, or prevent disease, to generate a prescription, or to replace the FDA-approved Prescribing Information.
