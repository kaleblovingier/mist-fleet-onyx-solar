  "Displaying CYP450 substrate / inhibitor / inducer maps, FDA DDI fold-change grades, start/stop safety clocks (reversible vs time-dependent inactivation vs induction lag), and pharmacodynamic collision scores for drugs and foods on a user-selected regimen.",
  "Surfacing excerpts of FDA-approved labeling (boxed warnings, contraindications, drug interactions, pregnancy) retrieved from OpenFDA and DailyMed.",
  "Displaying published clinical scales (COWS, CIWA-Ar, Hunter criteria, CDC 2022 oral MME factors, Bazett / Fridericia, Cockcroft–Gault) with the published source named.",
  "Displaying labeled usual dose ranges, labeled maxima, and interaction dose-caps paraphrased from FDA-approved labeling, and checking a user-entered milligram against those rails.",
  "Displaying named labeled pharmacodynamic collisions (sofosbuvir–amiodarone bradycardia, clozapine–benzodiazepine respiratory collapse, dual RAAS blockade, fluoroquinolone–corticosteroid tendinopathy, and related boxed pairs) so the healthcare professional can independently review the basis.",
  "Displaying harm-reduction teaching (overdose response, test-strip limits, never-use-alone, recovery position, DanceSafe reagent instructions, PsychonautWiki / TripSit / SAMHSA / CDC paraphrases, and live wiki intros with dosage and route-how-to stripped) so the healthcare professional can independently review the basis. Not a protocol and not a milligram.",
  "Leading a pair check with the perpetrator, the victim, the direction of effect, the enzyme or receptor, and a source that can be opened. Contraindicated is its own tier, above major. The check does not pick a milligram.",
  "Showing food, drink, and alcohol rows for the names already on the desk, and pregnancy, CKD, older-adult, and daily-smoke rows labeled as a different host. Those rows are the same map. They are not a clearance and not a milligram.",
  "Ranking a regimen into pairs by the sharpest collision, and leading with a plain-language sentence of that row. The sentence does not pick a milligram or a next step.",
  "Building a shareable regimen brief that lists mapped pairs worst-first with a plain-language lead sentence, then whole-desk notes. Free desks may copy the brief for teaching. The brief does not pick a milligram or a next step.",
  "Displaying study cards (rounds, named labeled pairs, formulary CYP roles, FDA fold-change grades, and mechanism cards from the selected pair) so a healthcare trainee can rehearse the basis, mark misses, and review them. Not an exam key and not a milligram.",
  "Watching user-selected names for OpenFDA shortage and enforcement/recall excerpts so the healthcare professional can independently review the basis. Truncated teaching surface — not a shortage alert service and not a milligram.",
  "Linking CPIC / ClinPGx tables, PubMed PMIDs, DrugBank accessions, NIH RxClass, LactMed paraphrases, and ClinicalTrials.gov records for independent review.",
